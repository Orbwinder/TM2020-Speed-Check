# Speedlight

Trackmania 2020 plugin which provides instant feedback to the player on every jump, to make improving on speed-checks easier and more intuitive.

## Features
- Displays current vehicle speed in the style of the stadium car tail light
- Configurable layout & style
- High visibility animation indicates every time the car comes off the ground

(For the current gear at takeoff, I recommend my other plugin "Gear-Blocks")
